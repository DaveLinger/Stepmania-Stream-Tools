# What's Different in this Fork?
This is my fork of the project for the MrTwinkles47 and Danizom813 Twitch channels. The main differences in this fork are mostly methodology and optimizations of certain existing features.

A quick summary:
* Support for multiple channels/broadcasters with a single SM5 instance and song database.
* Complete rewrite of the songlist to support searching and display of additional song/chart information.
* New song scraper which iterates through the SM5 Cache directory instead of the Songs folder. This improves the parity of the database and StepMania.
  * Focus on indexing songs by their song_dir string--the method SM5 uses to differentiate songs.
  * New metadata is collected (and more can be added in the future) about each song including all chart information (sm_notedata database).
  * Downsides to using the Cache directory means that installing new songs requires SM5 to build the cache before the scraper will find the new songs.
  * Occasionally a purge of the Cache is needed if you delete a bunch of song packs.
  * Scraper will update songs if it detects that the cache file has changed, preserving the original song ID.
* New scraper for StepMania's Stats.xml files in the LocalProfile directory.
* Request lift mark-off method to use StepMania 5's built-in stats tracking files (Stats.xml) instead of the python/lua scripts.
  * NOTE: This method has its pros and cons. Pro: no need to modify your theme lua files; Con: some marks-off are missed due to the limited number of high score slots that are available.
  * The python/lua scripts can still be used (and have been slightly improved) with minor modifications to some mysql queries.
  * The lua script is updated to pass the SongDir() string, which improves matching songs in the database.
* Request list has some minor formatting and aesthetic changes.
  * New DDR-like font, addition of subtitles in the song name, special formatting of pack names (customizable), and a request type feature showing whether the request was normal or random.
  * Different new/cancel "dings."
* New banner image uploader finds the banner images for each song pack, formats the file name, and uploads it to the images/packs folder.
* Random request methods are *slightly* different. Special random requests are scalable and much quicker to add.
  * Create personal random requests for regulars of the channel (i.g. !randomHellKite, !randomdjfipu, !randomben).
  * New possible commands thanks to the collection of step/score statistics.
* Ability to ban songs via chat commands by song name or ID.
* Additional session stats including recent scores, high score lists, and shout-outs to frequent requestors.

## New Stuff

### Docker Support

To increase simplicity of deployment of the software, I have added support for Docker and Docker Compose. Simply install Docker Desktop on your machine, clone this repo, go into this directory (the one with docker-compose.yml in it) and run "docker-compose up". It should build and start all necessary software for you, auto-magically! You can access the song list at http://localhost . To add songs, just use the same mysql info from the includes/config.php file in the scraper file! Easy peasy!

---

There are several pieces to the puzzle here:

## 1. Song Scraper
This software looks through your Stepmania Songs folder and uploads info for each song to a remote mysql database.

## 2. Song Requests Scripts
This software allows incoming calls to request songs. I use this with moobot, a free web-based twitch bot. When somebody says "!request Some Song", moobot sends their twitch username and their requested song title to my requests script. The script searches the database created by the song scraper for songs matching the title. If there is more than one match, it returns the top 5 matches with their titles, packs, and ID numbers. A twitch user can use "!requestid 1234" to request a song by ID instead of by name. This is useful to pick a specific version of a song with a title shared by many tracks.

Additional rules could be added - for example, you could block users from requesting songs more often than you'd like, or prevent requests from users who have songs still in the request queue that have not yet been played. Currently, the only restriction is that users cannot request songs that have been requested within the past hour. You could add additional commands for certain users only. Restrict these at the moobot-level or the script level - for example to allow moderators to bypass rate limits, rules, or to cancel songs requested by others.

The !cancel command cancels the user's most recently requested song.

### Examples:

---

**ddrdave**: !request Algorithm

(moobot makes a call to "https://www.mywebsite.com/twitch/request.php?user=ddrdave&song=Algorithm")

(script responds with "ddrdave requested ALGORITHM from DDR A"

**moobot:** ddrdave requested ALGORITHM from DDR A

---

**ddrdave**: !request Trip Machine

(moobot makes a call to "https://www.mywebsite.com/twitch/request.php?user=ddrdave&song=Trip+Machine")

(script responds with "Top matches (request with !requestid \[song id\]): \[ 1090 > SP-TRIP MACHINE\~JUNGLE MIX\~ from DDR 2ndMIX \]\[ 3013 > SP-TRIP MACHINE\~JUNGLE MIX\~(SMM-Special) from PS2 - DDR X JP \]\[ 1939 > SP-TRIP MACHINE\~JUNGLE MIX\~(X-Special) from DDR X \]")

**moobot**: Top matches (request with !requestid \[song id\]): \[ 1090 > SP-TRIP MACHINE\~JUNGLE MIX\~ from DDR 2ndMIX \]\[ 3013 > SP-TRIP MACHINE\~JUNGLE MIX\~(SMM-Special) from PS2 - DDR X JP \]\[ 1939 > SP-TRIP MACHINE\~JUNGLE MIX\~(X-Special) from DDR X \]

---

**ddrdave**: !requestid 1090

(moobot makes a call to "https://www.mywebsite.com/twitch/request.php?user=ddrdave&songid=1090")

(script responds with "ddrdave requested SP-TRIP MACHINE\~JUNGLE MIX\~ from DDR 2ndMIX")

**moobot**: ddrdave requested SP-TRIP MACHINE~JUNGLE MIX~ from DDR 2ndMIX

---

**ddrdave**: !request Some Song That Doesn't Exist

(moobot makes a call to "https://www.mywebsite.com/twitch/request.php?user=ddrdave&song=Some+Song+That+Doesnt+Exist")

**moobot**: Didn't find any songs matching that name!

---

**ddrdave**: !requestid 1090

(moobot makes a call to "https://www.mywebsite.com/twitch/request.php?user=ddrdave&songid=1090")

**moobot**: That song has already been requested recently!

---

**ddrdave**: !cancel

(moobot makes a call to "https://www.mywebsite.com/twitch/request.php?user=ddrdave&cancel")

(script responds with "Canceled ddrdave's request for SP-TRIP MACHINE\~JUNGLE MIX\~")

**moobot:** Canceled ddrdave's request for SP-TRIP MACHINE\~JUNGLE MIX\~

## 3. Song List Script
This is just a php web page that pulls the whole list of songs from the song scraper's DB and displays them with IDs, by pack for easy viewing. I have moobot setup to provide a link to this script when a user types "!songlist" or "!songs".

### Example:

**ddrdave**: !songlist

**moobot**: The song list can be found here: https://www.mywebsite.com/twitch/songlist.php

## 4. Requests List Web Widget
This is the web view of the current requests list. This is shown in OBS as a web source. It checks for new requests, completions, and cancelations every 5 seconds. It adds new song requests to the top of the list, removes canceled requests from the list, and applies a specific CSS class to completed songs (dim them and applies a green checkmark). It plays a sound effect when a song is requested, and a different sound when a song is canceled. It uses Jquery and CSS to do fancy animations for each. This page hits a specific php script that returns the new song requests (etc). More details in the readme for the request list widget.

## 5. Stepmania Scene Switching and Song Output
On my stream, I have OBS automatically switch between a "song select/evalution" scene (which shows the whole screen capture), calories burned, face camera, etc) and a "gameplay" scene, which only shows the Player 1 side of the video capture, as well as the input overlay, overhead camera, and current heart rate reading. The way this is accomplished is by having Stepmania output text to a specific text file when it switches to or from one of those screens.

I also output the currently-being-played song title to a different text file. This allows me to "check off" songs that have been requested, as soon as the song starts. This requires the use of a python script I wrote on the computer running Stepmania to watch for changes to this file, and send them off to a php script on my remote web server to parse. Details in the relevant readme.

## 6. Pulsoid Food/Calories Web Widget
I use Pulsoid (free) to display my current heart rate BPM on stream from my Wahoo Tickr heart rate strap. Pulsoid also offers a "calories burned" counter. I copied and modified that page to instead display total calories burned in relation to common food items, similar to DDR A.

## 7. DDR Input Indicator
I use an OBS plugin called **[Input Overlay](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/input-overlay.552/)** to achieve this - I had to make a custom config file and two custom graphics for this, which I'll include here in the repo. The other key factor here is you need to get the keyboard inputs from your stepmania machine onto your streaming machine, or this won't work. So I use a piece of free software called **[Input Director](https://www.inputdirector.com)** to mirror the keyboard inputs from the Stepmania PC to the streaming PC. There's virtually no latency. Install the software on both PCs, setup your steaming PC as a slave and use the software on your Stepmania PC to "Mirror keyboard input across slaves".


# Non-Bug Issues

- Moobot has some kind of automatic cooldown for chat, so if it gets invoked many times back to back, it will whisper responses to the users invoking it, rather than posting them in chat. Everything still works.
