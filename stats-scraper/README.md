# What is this?

The scraper parses all the high score entries from your StepMania profile folder. This can be used as a record of songs played, session high score table, or used for special request commands based on scores. I am using this stats scraper method as my request list "check-off" script instead of the python script method. 

# How to use this

Run the "scrape_stats.php" from the cli. In this folder is a powershell script, which triggers this script everytime any Stats.xml file is updated (usually at the song evaluation screen).
