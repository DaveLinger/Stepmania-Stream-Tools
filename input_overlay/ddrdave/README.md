## What's all this?

Okay, so what you are looking at here is a "ddrdave" folder with 3 files inside.

This is a "theme" or "profile" for the **[Input Overlay](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/input-overlay.552/)** plugin for OBS.

It doesn't matter where you put this folder. Just stick it somewhere and add an Input Overlay source. In the source properties, select arrows.png as the **Overlay image file** and select ddr.ini as the **Layout config file**.

Then, for aesthetics, you can add stage.png as an image source BELOW the input overlay source, to make it look like a real DDR stage instead of floating arrows (optional).

### Note

ddr.ini contains configuration for which keypresses correspond to which arrows presses. This is the config file as **I** use it, which is NOT the default stepmania key bindings. So you may need to adjust this to work with your bindings, or adjust your bindings to match this config.
